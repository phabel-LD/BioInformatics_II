# mushroom_kNN_clasification
## Description
This work accomplishes a supervised machine learning classification based on vector spaces to classify mushrooms into *edible* and *poisonous* according to their physical features by applying the *k-Nearest Neighbors* (kNN) method.

## Motivation
Mushroom classification and further selection based on its physical attributes is far from trivial, since there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom, therefore, ML classification methods such as kNN could help to accomplish that.

## System requirements
No system requirements needed.

## Install/Import
Import **sklearn** Python library v1.0.2.
Import **matplotlib**, **pandas**, **numpy**, **csv** and **seaborn** Python libraries for data processing and visualization.
